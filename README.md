## Technical Overview

The Meal Management Microservice is a sophisticated, domain-driven solution architected with clean architecture principles and implemented using .NET 8. This microservice exemplifies modern software engineering practices through its rigorous adherence to SOLID principles, separation of concerns, and implementation of the CQRS pattern with MediatR.

### Architectural Excellence

The system is meticulously structured into four distinct layers:

```
Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API
```

This layered architecture enforces the Dependency Inversion Principle, ensuring that high-level modules remain independent of low-level implementation details. The core domain logic is completely isolated from infrastructure concerns, resulting in a highly testable and maintainable codebase.

### Technical Stack Highlights

- **Framework**: .NET 8 with minimal API endpoints
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with strict boundary enforcement
- **Design Pattern**: CQRS implementation with MediatR for command/query separation
- **Authentication**: JWT token-based authentication with Firebase OTP verification
- **Validation**: Fluent Validation for robust request validation
- **Database**: Oracle Database with optimized query performance
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core with Oracle provider and repository pattern abstraction
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger with comprehensive security schema definitions
- **Dependency Injection**: Native .NET DI container with service lifetimes optimization

### Advanced Implementation Features

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models with encapsulated business logic
- **Immutable DTOs**: Transfer objects designed for serialization efficiency
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Task-based Asynchronous Pattern throughout the application
- **Repository Abstraction**: Generic repository pattern with specification pattern
- **Firebase Integration**: Secure OTP verification and push notification services
- **JWT Authentication**: Claims-based authorization with role-based access control
- **Exception Middleware**: Centralized exception handling with problem details responses
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing

### Oracle Database Integration

- **Entity Framework Core Oracle Provider**: Optimized data access layer
- **Advanced Query Optimization**: Leveraging Oracle-specific query features
- **Stored Procedures**: Strategic use of Oracle stored procedures for complex operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized database connection management
- **Transaction Management**: ACID-compliant transaction handling
- **Database Migration**: Automated schema evolution with EF Core migrations
- **Performance Tuning**: Oracle-specific indexing and query plan optimization

### Security Implementation

The microservice implements multiple layers of security:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- **Password Security**: BCrypt hashing with salt generation
- **Input Validation**: Request validation at application boundary
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing policies
- **Rate Limiting**: API throttling to prevent abuse
- **Secure Headers**: Implementation of security headers (HSTS, X-XSS-Protection)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized EF Core queries with eager loading strategies
- **Response Caching**: Strategic caching for frequently accessed resources
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Non-blocking I/O operations throughout
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connection optimization
- **Minimal API Surface**: Reduced overhead compared to traditional controllers

This microservice demonstrates mastery of modern .NET development practices, clean architecture principles, and secure API design patterns—making it an exemplary showcase of advanced software engineering capabilities.
